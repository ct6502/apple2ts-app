# Apple2TS Game Asset Configuration Guide

This guide explains how to create a branded version of Apple2TS for your Apple II game.

## Overview

Each game configuration lives in its own folder under `assets/`. The folder name should be lowercase with no spaces (e.g., `noxarchaist`, `mygame`).

To create a branded build of your game:
```bash
APPLE2TS_CONFIG=yourgame npm run package
```

This will create a fully branded app with your game's name, icons, splash screen, and configuration baked in.

## Folder Structure

```
assets/
  yourgame/          # Your game's asset folder (lowercase, no spaces)
    config.json      # Game configuration (required)
    MacOS.icns       # macOS app icon (required)
    Windows.ico      # Windows app icon (required)
    App.png          # App icon for runtime & Linux (required)
    splash.jpg       # Splash screen image (required)
    Header.png       # Header image for About dialog (required)

## Building Your Branded App

### 1. Create Your Asset Folder

```bash
cd assets
mkdir yourgame
cd yourgame
```

### 2. Add Required Files

Place all 6 required files in your folder:
- `config.json`
- `MacOS.icns`
- `Windows.ico`
- `App.png`
- `splash.jpg`
- `Header.png`

### 3. Build the App

```bash
# Package the app
APPLE2TS_CONFIG=yourgame npx electron-forge package

# Or create distributables
APPLE2TS_CONFIG=yourgame npx electron-forge make
```

### 4. Distribute

Your branded app will be in:
- `out/Your Game Name-darwin-arm64/Your Game Name.app` (macOS)
- `out/Your Game Name-win32-x64/` (Windows)
- `out/Your Game Name-linux-x64/` (Linux)

Place your disk image (matching the pattern in config.json) next to the app bundle before distributing.

## Example: Nox Archaist Configuration

The `noxarchaist` folder provides a complete working example:

```
assets/noxarchaist/
  config.json          # Name: "Nox Archaist", diskImage: "NoxArchaist*.hdv"
  MacOS.icns          # App icon for macOS
  Windows.ico         # App icon for Windows  
  App.png             # Runtime icon
  splash.jpg          # 616x353 splash screen
  Header.png          # 460x215 header for About dialog
```

Build it with:
```bash
APPLE2TS_CONFIG=noxarchaist npx electron-forge package
```

## Troubleshooting

**App doesn't show my branding:**
- Verify `APPLE2TS_CONFIG=yourgame` is set during build
- Check that your asset folder name matches (lowercase, no spaces)
- Ensure all 6 required files are present

**Icons don't appear:**
- Check file formats (.icns, .ico, .png)
- Verify image dimensions match specifications
- Rebuild the app after updating icons

**Disk image not loading:**
- Ensure disk image is next to the .app bundle (not inside it)
- Check filename matches pattern in config.json
- Look for console messages about disk loading

**Splash screen doesn't show:**
- Verify splash.jpg is exactly 616x353 pixels
- Check file size (should be under 1MB)
- Ensure it's a valid JPEG file
